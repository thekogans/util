libthekogans_util is at the heart of every other library and
program. It contains a lot of reusable, cross-platform code designed
to hide platform specific details from other, higher level libraries
and programs. The library is developed, and tested on Windows, Linux,
and OS X, in both 32 and 64 bit modes, and on little and big endian
architectures (x86, MIPS, ARM…). A lot of effort has been made to make
sure libthekogans_util is semantically equivalent on all supported
platforms.

libthekogans_util is fully UTF8 compliant (the only Unicode format
that makes any sense IMHO). All methods that accept a std::string
will internally convert them to UTF16 on Windows and call 'W' APIs.
When receiving strings from Windows, again, 'W' APIs are used and
the results are converted to UTF8 before being returned to the caller.
libthekogans_util is completely _UNICODE ambivalent (it will behave
the same whether the macro is defined or not).

Here is a complete feature list:

    - A type system (Types.h, Constants.h) to hide platform specific
      types.

    - A full featured JSON parser/formatter (JSON.h). Supports Variant
      for numbers (f64, i64, ui64). Supports multiline text through a
      clever Array ctor.

    - A collection of useful, simple, and lightweight types (Flags.h,
      Variant.h, GUID.h, Fraction.h, Array.h, FixedArray.h, BitSet.h).

    - A collection of standard container wrappers (AbstractOwnerList.h,
      AbstractOwnerVector.h, OwnerList.h, OwnerVector.h, OwnerMap.h)
      which help with lifetime management of heap allocated objects.

    - An intrusive list (IntrusiveList.h) used in many situations
      where std::list is not appropriate.

    - A std::exception extension class (Exception.h) which uses a
      trace-back mechanism to track the path of an exception as it is
      being unwound.

    - A high resolution timer (HRTimer.h, HRTimerMgr.h) which can be
      used to help with code profiling.

    - A millisecond resolution periodic timer (Timer.h) designed to be
      used where accuracy is not paramount (idle processing…).

    - A platform independent time interval (TimeSpec.h). This class
      abstracts the time interval used by all timer, thread, and
      synchronization classes, and provides a uniform way to specify a
      timeout value.

    - A full featured logging framework (LoggerMgr.h, Logger.h,
      ConsoleLogger.h, FileLogger.h, MemoryLogger.h, NSLogLogger.h
      OutputDebugStringLogger.h).

    - A per class heap (Heap.h), which makes memory management a
      breeze. It also provides built in diagnostics for leaks, and
      double free (two of the nastiest memory bugs).

    - An extensible collection of allocators (Allocator.h,
      DefaultAllocator.h, AlignedAllocator.h, SecureAllocator.h,
      SharedAllocator.h, HGLOBALAllocator.h, NullAllocator.h) that
      plug in to Heap and Buffer.

    - A set of concurrency/synchronization wrappers (Thread.h,
      NullLock.h, SpinLock.h, Mutex.h, Semaphore.h, Barrier.h,
      SpinRWLock.h, RWLock.h, Condition.h, Event.h, TimeSpec.h,
      LockGuard.h, RWLockGuard.h, SharedObject.h) designed to put
      a uniform api on top of pthreads, and Windows specific
      threading api.

    - A run loop framework (RunLoop.h, DefaultRunLoop.h, SystemRunLoop.h
      MainRunLoop.h, JobQueue.h) for executing RunLoop::Jobs on any thread,
      including main.

    - A collection of process classes (ChildProcess.h, DynamicLibrary.h)
      used to instantiate child processes, and load shared libraries
      (*.so, *.dylib, *.dll).

    - A set of higher level threading abstractions (JobQueue.h,
      JobQueuePool.h, Pipeline.h, PipelinePool.h, Vectorizer.h,
      Scheduler.h, RunLoopScheduler.h) useful in many different
      situations.

    - An extensible collection of hashers (Hash.h, MD5.h, SHA1.h,
      SHA2.h, SHA3.h, SHA2_224_256.h, SHA2_384_512.h) to aid in the
      use of third party libraries.

    - A set of classes (File.h, Directory.h, Path.h, MimeTypeMapper.h)
      designed to help when dealing with file system objects. Of
      these, Directory is especially noteworthy. It implements such
      advanced, and useful features as; platform independent file
      system traversal, and an asynchronous directory change
      watcher/notifier.

    - A binary serializer framework (Serializable.h, Serializer.h,
      Buffer.h, FixedBuffer.h, File.h). It’s main purpose is to provide
      serialization/deserialization services for binary protocols.

    - A set of utilities to help with processing xml (XercesUtils.h,
      XMLUtils.h)

    - A collection of string utilities (StringUtils.h) used to hide
      platform inconsistencies.

    - A collection of platform specific utilities (LinuxUtils.h,
      OSXUtils.h, WindowsUtils.h, XlibUtils.h).

    - A reference counted base class (RefCounted.h).

    - A cryptographically secure random byte stream (RandomSource.h).

    - Application plugin manager (Plugins.h).

    - A set of miscellaneous classes (Config.h, Version.h, Console.h,
      CommandLineOptions.h, Singleton.h, SystemInfo.h, ByteSwap.h,
      Base64.h, Point.h, Rectangle.h, CRC32.h).
