        ///
        /// When calling Signal:
        ///
        /// The state of a manual-reset event object remains signaled
        /// until it is set explicitly to the non-signaled state by the
        /// Reset function. Any number of waiting threads, or threads
        /// that subsequently begin wait operations for the specified
        /// event object by calling Wait, can be released while the
        /// object's state is signaled.
        ///
        /// The state of an auto-reset event object remains signaled
        /// until a single waiting thread is released, at which time
        /// the system automatically sets the state to non-signaled.
        /// If no threads are waiting, the event object's state remains
        /// signaled.
        ///
        /// Setting an event that is already set has no effect.
        ///
        /// When calling SignalAll:
        ///
        /// For a manual-reset event object, all waiting threads that
        /// can be released immediately are released. The event object's
        /// state is then reset to non-signaled state.
        ///
        /// For an auto-reset event object, SignalAll releases at most
        /// one waiting thread, even if multiple threads are waiting.
        /// Regardless of whether a thread was released or not, event
        /// object's state is reset to non-signaled.
        ///
